# Manual Testing Strategy

This project uses manual testing until automated tests are added.

- The `develop` branch deploys to a staging environment for testing.
- The `main` branch deploys to production.

Use the [PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md](PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md) during each round of testing.
Track issues in `playtest_logs/` as needed.
