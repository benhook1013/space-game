# üöÄ Space Miner Plan

Tiny mobile‚Äëfirst 2D space miner built with Flutter and Flame. Players harvest
minerals from asteroids while periodic enemy waves keep the action moving.
Target is an offline PWA that a solo developer can iterate on quickly.
See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for architecture details. All design docs are now
in sync, and tasks are broken down in the milestone docs and consolidated in
[TASKS.md](TASKS.md) so we can start coding.

## üéØ Goals

- Offline play in the browser using Flutter + Flame
- Installable PWA with touch controls
- Code and asset base kept tiny and easy to maintain
- Ship quickly and iterate in small increments
- Responsive scaling so the same build works on phones, tablets and desktop
- Static dark colour palette; no runtime theme switching
- Solo-friendly workflow with minimal tooling
- Core loop focused on mining asteroids for minerals while fending off enemy
  groups
- Auto-firing mining laser targets asteroids while the main cannon locks onto
  the closest enemy
- A blue Tractor Aura around the ship pulls in nearby pickups
- Minerals feed a broad upgrade tree for weapons and ship systems in later
  milestones

## üö´ Non‚ÄëGoals

- Analytics, accounts or other backend services
- Multiplayer or native builds (future work)
- Large asset pipelines or complex tooling

## üß≠ Design Principles

- Keep the entire project understandable by one person
- Prefer built‚Äëin Flame and Flutter features over custom frameworks
- Optimize for quick iteration and avoid unnecessary abstraction
- Keep dependencies minimal‚Äîstick to core Flutter, Flame, and a few small plugins
- Build only the features needed for the current milestone;
  defer extras until they are actually required
- Favor readability over micro‚Äëoptimisation so future maintenance stays simple
- Avoid code generation or heavy frameworks so builds stay fast and debugging
  remains straightforward
- Collect tunable values (speeds, spawn rates, etc.) in a small `constants.dart`
  so balancing is easy and numbers aren't scattered across files
- Prefer composition over inheritance when adding behaviours
- Pass dependencies through constructors where possible; keep singletons rare
- Use simple state handling (plain classes or `ValueNotifier`s) instead of
  heavyweight patterns like BLoC or Redux

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Repository

- Public GitHub repo `space-game`
- Contains `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `AGENTS.md`, `fvm_config.json`,
  `.analysis_options.yaml`
- `pubspec.yaml` and Flutter source folders are generated after running
  `fvm flutter create .`
- Commit the generated Flutter skeleton so a fresh clone builds immediately
- Include a barebones `pubspec.yaml` with pinned `flame`, `flame_audio`, and
  `shared_preferences` versions
- `AGENTS.md` captures coding and architecture guidelines
- Commit `pubspec.lock` so dependency versions stay consistent
- Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow that lints, tests and deploys the web
  build; avoid complex pipelines until needed

### Flutter & FVM

- FVM manages its own Flutter and Dart SDK; no separate Dart install required
- Install FVM if needed: `dart pub global activate fvm`
- `fvm install` then `fvm use` to fetch and activate the pinned Flutter SDK
- Run `fvm flutter create .` once to scaffold the Flutter project
  if the skeleton isn't already committed
- Flutter version is defined in `fvm_config.json` (currently `3.32.8`)
- `fvm flutter doctor` then `fvm flutter pub get`
- Enable web: `fvm flutter config --enable-web`
- Run with `fvm flutter run -d chrome` for debug or `-d web-server` for PWA tests
- Pin the Flame version in `pubspec.yaml`; always use `fvm` commands

## üîÅ Workflow

- Use Codespaces or any lightweight editor (VS Code, GitHub Mobile, Replit)
- Work directly on `main`; branch only for larger features
- Commit small, frequent changes with messages like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`
- Track to‚Äëdos in a simple `TASKS.md` to keep solo development focused
- Run `fvm dart format .` and `fvm dart analyze` before committing
- After editing docs, run `npx markdownlint-cli '**/*.md'` to keep Markdown tidy

  plus optional `DESIGN.md`, `TASKS.md`, `milestone-*.md`
- Each of `lib/`, `assets/`, `web/` and `test/` includes a `README.md`
  describing its contents, with additional design notes in
  `lib/main.md`, `lib/assets.md`, `lib/constants.md` and `lib/log.md`
- Keep `README.md` and other docs updated as features change and remove any
  stale sections

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- `SpaceGame` extends `FlameGame` in `lib/game/space_game.dart`
- `GameWidget` hosts the game and overlays menus/HUD
- Use Flame overlays (`overlays` map) for menu and game-over screens so UI code
  stays separate from the game loop
- Components live in `lib/components/`
  (`player.dart`, `enemy.dart`, `asteroid.dart`, `bullet.dart`‚Ä¶)
- Keep the core `SpaceGame` lean by delegating logic to small helper classes
- An `EnemySpawner` emits groups on a timer, and the player mounts an auto-fire
  mining laser plus a primary cannon that targets the nearest enemy.
- On‚Äëscreen joystick and shoot button; WASD + Space mirror touch controls
- Use Flame's built-in `JoystickComponent` and `ButtonComponent` for touch input
- Keyboard support comes from `KeyboardListenerComponent`
- States: **menu ‚Üí playing ‚Üí paused ‚Üí game over** with quick restart or
  return to menu
- Use a `GameState` enum to manage transitions
- Centralize asset paths in an `Assets` helper that preloads sprites, audio and
  fonts so gameplay code never references file paths directly
- Favor small composable components over inheritance
- Components that need to access the game should mix in
  `HasGameReference<SpaceGame>` instead of using global singletons
- Keep Flutter UI widgets separate from game state updates
- If saving is needed later, add IDs and JSON‚Äëserializable state
  - Camera follows the player via `CameraComponent` with no world bounds,
    and the parallax starfield tiles infinitely to avoid blank space
- Use `HasCollisionDetection` for collisions with simple `CircleHitbox`/`RectangleHitbox`
  shapes and a timer-based spawner
- Top‚Äëdown view with a simple parallax starfield background using Flame's
  `ParallaxComponent`
- Aim for 60 FPS and avoid heavy per‚Äëframe allocations
- For frequently spawned objects, bullets, asteroids and enemies use simple
  object pools to reduce garbage collection overhead
- A lightweight `GameEventBus` emits component spawn and remove events so
  systems like the targeting service and pool manager can react without
  direct references
- `PoolManager` owns these pools and keeps a spatial grid of asteroids for
  efficient proximity queries
- Movement and animations should be time‚Äëbased using `dt` to stay consistent
  across frame rates
- Rely on Flame's `update`/`render` lifecycle; avoid custom game loops

## üéÆ MVP

- Touch/joystick movement and shooting
- Shooting uses a short cooldown to limit fire rate
- Enemy groups spawn periodically; the main weapon smoothly auto-aims at the closest foe
- Asteroids drop mineral pickups when mined with an auto-targeting laser;
  destroying enemies also grants points
- A blue Tractor Aura around the ship pulls in nearby pickups
- Single endless level without progression for now
- Player score, minerals and health shown in the HUD with simple
  start/game‚Äëover screens
- Toggable top-left minimap shows nearby asteroids, enemies and pickups
- HUD button or `B` key toggles coloured range rings showing targeting, Tractor Aura and mining radii
- Local high score stored on device (e.g., shared preferences)
- Menu offers a reset button to clear the high score
- Menu allows choosing between multiple ship sprites and remembers the selection
- Basic sound effects using `flame_audio` with mute toggle (button or `M` key)
  available on menu, HUD and game over overlays
- Keyboard controls for desktop playtests (`WASD`/arrow keys to move, `Space` to
  shoot, `Escape` or `P` to pause or resume, `M` to mute, `N` toggles the
  minimap, `F1` toggles debug overlays, `Enter` starts or restarts from the
  menu or game over, `R` restarts at any time, `H` shows a help overlay that
  `Esc` also closes, `U` opens an upgrades overlay that `Esc` also closes, `B`
  toggles range rings)
- Upgrades overlay lets players spend minerals on simple upgrades that
  persist between sessions, opened with a HUD button or the `U` key and
  pausing gameplay
- Settings overlay with sliders for HUD, text, joystick, targeting, Tractor Aura
  and mining ranges, plus a reset button
- Game works offline after the first load thanks to the service worker
- Simple parallax starfield background
- Pause or resume with a `PAUSED` overlay prompting players to press `Esc` or
  `P` to resume; `Q` returns to the menu from pause or game over

## üóìÔ∏è Milestones

- **Setup** ‚Äì basic project scaffolding runs in the browser with placeholder assets
- **Core Loop** ‚Äì player moves and shoots, one enemy type, basic scoring
- **Polish** ‚Äì starfield background, sound effects, and local high score

Detailed tasks for each milestone live in
[milestone-setup.md](milestone-setup.md),
[milestone-core-loop.md](milestone-core-loop.md) and
[milestone-polish.md](milestone-polish.md). The combined backlog is maintained
in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).

## üé® Assets & PWA

### Assets

- `assets/images/`, `assets/audio/`, `assets/fonts/`
- Placeholder shapes or colors are fine early;
  document sources in `ASSET_GUIDE.md` and credit in `ASSET_CREDITS.md`
- Prefer CC0 or similar licenses and keep total assets <5 MB
- Maintain a versioned `assets_manifest.json` to track assets for each release
  and help with caching (see `assets_manifest.md`)

### PWA & Deployment

- `web/manifest.json` with:
  - `start_url` `/`
  - `display` `standalone`
  - landscape orientation
  - `background_color` `#000000`
  - `theme_color` `#0f0f0f`
- Icons 192x192 and 512x512 in `web/icons/`
- Custom `sw.js` precaches assets listed in `assets_manifest.json` and
  handles runtime caching
- Build with `fvm flutter build web --release`
- Test with `fvm flutter run -d web-server`
- Deploy via GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`) using a GitHub Actions workflow
  to publish `build/web`
- When targeting GitHub Pages, build with
  `fvm flutter build web --release --base-href /space-game/` so asset paths
  resolve correctly
- Update `web/index.html` metadata (title, description) to match the game

## ‚úçÔ∏è Style & Testing

- Format with `fvm dart format .`
- Analyze with `fvm dart analyze` (guided by `.analysis_options.yaml`)
- Lint docs with `npx markdownlint-cli '**/*.md'`
- Once tests exist, run `fvm flutter test`
- Use `flutter_test` for widget tests and `flame_test` for component/system tests
  once tests are added
- Cover object pools with unit tests to ensure instances are reused
- Manual testing for now; automate later under `test/`
- Use `PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md`, `MANUAL_TESTING.md`, and optional `playtest_logs/`
- Follow `AGENTS.md` conventions when contributing
- Enable Flame's debug mode in dev builds to show bounding boxes and FPS;
  toggle at runtime with the `F1` key
- Add a tiny `log()` helper around `debugPrint` so messages can be silenced in release

## üåå World Exploration

The current build uses a single-screen play area. To let players roam, expand
the world beyond the viewport and have the camera track the ship.

- Treat space as effectively infinite; avoid hard world bounds.
- Attach a `CameraComponent` that follows the player without clamping.
- Continuously spawn asteroids, enemies and pickups ahead of the ship and
  despawn any far behind to keep the scene light.
- Tile the parallax starfield or otherwise prevent gaps as the camera moves.
- A small togglable minimap in the top-left aids navigation through the endless world.

## üîÆ Future Ideas

- **Multiplayer** (`networking.md`): host‚Äëauthoritative co‚Äëop via WebSocket
- **Backend (optional)**: local storage sync or Firebase
- **Native deployment (optional)**: Codemagic, Play Store, TestFlight
- Additional features: inventory, extensive mineral-based upgrade tree for
  weapons and ship systems, HUD, menus, shop UI, save/load

## üîÅ Daily Loop

```text
1. Edit code or docs
2. Push to GitHub
3. CI builds the PWA
