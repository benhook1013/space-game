# üöÄ Space Miner PWA

**Space Miner** is a mobile-first, Codex-assisted 2D space shooter where players
fly around, mine asteroids, blast enemies and upgrade their ship ‚Äî all built
with **Flutter** and **Flame**.

The aim is a light-hearted, cartoony game that runs smoothly on both mobile and
desktop browsers using **Progressive Web App (PWA)** technology. You can
install it straight from your browser and play offline with no app store
required.

Multiplayer is planned as a simple host-authoritative co-op mode where one
player simulates the world and others connect over the local network ‚Äî no
dedicated server or NAT traversal.
