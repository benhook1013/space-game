# test/

Contains automated tests covering core services and game components.

Current suites verify:

- Storage and audio services
- Object pooling for bullets, asteroids and enemies
- Player shot cooldown logic
- Help overlay pause behaviour

Tests use `flutter_test` and `flame_test` as noted in [../PLAN.md](../PLAN.md).
