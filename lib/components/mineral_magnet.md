# MineralMagnetComponent

Blue gradient aura surrounding the player that attracts nearby mineral pickups.

## Behaviour

- Follows the player and renders a radial blue gradient.
- Pulls `MineralComponent`s toward the ship within a fixed radius using
  values from `constants.dart`.

See [../../PLAN.md](../../PLAN.md) for the broader roadmap.
